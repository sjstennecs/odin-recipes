As per The Odin Project's Recipe Project:

The git workflow goes something like this...

Creating Repository
1. On GitHub create a new repository
2. Give your repository a name, check add README
3. To get ready to clone repo to machine: click the Green "Code" button
 then select the SSH option and copy the line below it
4. On your local machine create a directory to clone your repo to
5. Use git clone followed the the link from step 3
6. Should be set; to verify its all good enter git remote -v

Use the Git workflow:
1. Create a file in the cloned repo
2. git status to check staging
3. Type git add [file you made in step 1] to add it to the staging area
(staging area is like a waiting room for changes until committed)
4. Check again with git status
5. Type git commit -m "Add [file name]"
6. Type git log to check for an entry about line 5
7. Use git add . to add all files in the current directory to staging area
8. Finally lets commit them all with:
git commit -m "message"
9. After things are committed, they need to be uploaded to the repo
To do this type: git push (specfically git push origin main since there is no branch other than main at this time)
